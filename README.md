Today’s project focuses on building a **Movie Recommendation System** using Python to suggest movies based on user preferences and ratings.

## ⚡ Key Features
- Recommend movies similar to a user’s favorites
- Analyze movie ratings to improve suggestions
- Explore patterns in user preferences and genres
- Provide a Python-based interface for testing recommendations

## 💡 What We Learned
- Using **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data preprocessing
- Implementing **collaborative filtering** for recommendation engines
- Understanding **cosine similarity** and its role in suggestions
- Building practical Python programs for user recommendations

## 🖥️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn (for similarity computations)
